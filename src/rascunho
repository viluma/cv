TO WHOM IT MIGHT CONCERN

My name is Vivian Seerup.

I am 25 years old and from Beira, Mozambique. 2 years ago I relocated to Dragør, where I am currently living with my Danish husband and my 1 year old daughter.

I have a bachelor degree in IT engineering from Zambeze university. My plan is to apply at ITU next year to finish my master degree within IT-project management.

I read your job post for Office Assistant with much interest. The outlined work responsibilities match my personality and work experience. 

I am a very outgoing and positive person. I am open to new challenges and I am very organized, disciplined and team oriented.. These qualities made me representative of the students in my class at University.

While studying I held an internship at the Mozambique International Airport. As Assistant Technician I provided technical help to all departments in the airport. I organized food supplies, digital and physical files within the different sectors. I wrote daily reports to the management on equipment operation. Furthermore I had various miscellaneous tasks supporting the daily operation in the airport.

This job would be a perfect opportunity for me as I find your company a very inspiring workplace. My daughter is starting in day care very soon and I would enjoy being a part of your organization.

My Danish is not currently optimal, but I understand most and I am working very hard to get up to speed.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your consideration..
